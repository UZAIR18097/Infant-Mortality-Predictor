# Infant-Mortality-Predictor
The project was for Foundation to Data Science course in my fourth semester during my Bachelors. It uses Pakistan and Demographic Health Survey (2017-2018) for predictive analysis on Infant Mortality.It was a classification task where one had to predict whether an infant will survive or not.
In this project, I performed Data preprocessing techniques like data cleaning and wrangling to make data ready for my model.Six Classifiers including Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines were developed and fine tuned to make prediction.
All the coding for the project has been done in Coding on Infant Mortality.ipynb.The model deployed Random Forest which can be found in model.py.Finally,the Report.pdf summarizes the methodology and results for the project
